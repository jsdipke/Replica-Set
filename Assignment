	1. What are the differences file-wise?
	Apiversion is placed at aap/ location in rs
	Kind for rc is ReplicationController and ReplicaSet for rs
	Name is kubia2 for rc and kubia for rs
	
	2. Run the kubia-replicaset.yaml .
	
	3. Identify what commands can be run after "kubectl apply...."
	kubectl apply -f kubia-replicaset.yaml
	kubectl get po
	kubectl get rs
	4. Make a service over these pods (kubia-replicaset) and see if the service picks up the web-service within the pod ("You have hit....." message)
	kubectl get svc
	[root@ip-172-31-31-219 05-services]# curl 10.99.10.100:80
	You've hit kubia-dtcpp
	[root@ip-172-31-31-219 05-services]#
	Pods are changing frequently 
	5. Negative Testing : change the labels of the pod and see if the service is still applied on those pods
kubectl label po kubia-w25r6 app=mavenir --overwrite
After changing name one more pod created with existing pod 
I was replaced replica 3 to 1 now only one pod was there and service running on it, after changing lable of pod one more pod created and service running on newly created pod.
